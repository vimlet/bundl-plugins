# bundl-plugins

The project root should have a directory for each plugin named an each directory name should end in '-plugin`.

Plugins will be published to the NPM org @bundl.

The suggested nomenclature for the plugins is `@bundl/name` since they are already scoped under @bundl. 

*Examples:* 
```
@bundl/babel
@bundl/typescript
@bundl/less
@nundl/uglify
```
